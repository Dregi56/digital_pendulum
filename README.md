## 📌 Description

Digital Pendulum is a custom integration for Home Assistant that vocally announces the time, just like a digital pendulum 🕰️.

Using a compatible smart speaker as a player, the system:

- 📢 announces the time every hour and/or every half hour (configurable)
- 🌍 automatically speaks in the language set in Home Assistant  
- ⏰ only works within a configurable time slot 
- 🔔 can play a custom sound before the announcement
- 🔕 can disable the voice announcement (bell only)
- 🏰 can play the Westminster chime at 12 o'clock

The result is an elegant and discreet effect, ideal for home or office.

## 🔊 Supported Devices

Digital Pendulum supports three player types:

| Type | Description | Requirement |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Alexa** | Amazon Echo devices | [alexa_media_player](https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player) via HACS |
| **Google Home / Nest** | Google Home, Nest Mini, Nest Hub, Chromecast | Google Cast (native HA integration) |
| **Generic** | Any other HA media_player device | TTS engine configured in HA (functionality may vary) |

During setup you will be asked to select the player type first, then the specific device.

## ✨ Main features

### 🕑 Automatic time announcement
- every hour (xx:00)
- every half hour (xx:30) - optional

### 🌐 Automatic multilingual support
- Italian 🇮🇹
- English 🇬🇧
- French 🇫🇷
- German 🇩🇪 (with correct handling of "halb")
- Spanish 🇪🇸
- Polish 🇵🇱
  
automatic fallback to Italian

### ⏱️ Configurable time slot
- e.g. only from 8:00 to 22:00

###  🔔 Optional bell
- 🎵 12 preset sounds to choose from
- 🎶 option to use a custom audio file
- 🔕 default notification sound (if nothing is selected)

### 🧪 Test function
- to immediately try the announcement

### 🎯 Behaviour

**Bell (Chime):**
- **Available presets**: 12 sounds including church-bell, simple-bell, clock-chime, etc.
- **Custom sound**: Select "custom" and enter the path of your audio file
- **Default**: notification sound (if you select nothing)
- **Disabled**: Disable "use_chime" for no sound before the announcement

**Westminster Melody (Tower Clock):**
- Separate "tower_clock" option
- Plays **only at 12:00** (noon)
- Replaces the normal chime at that time

**Voice announcement:**
- **Enabled** (default): the device pronounces the time after the bell
- **Disabled**: Bell sound only, no voice announcement

**Half-hour announcements:**
- **Enabled** (default): Announcements at :00 and :30
- **Disabled**: Announcements at :00 only

## ⚙️ How it works

Digital Pendulum synchronises with the system clock and automatically checks every minute whether it is time to make an announcement.

**When the announcement triggers:**
1. 🔔 Plays the chosen bell (if enabled)
2. ⏱️ Waits 1.2 seconds
3. 🗣️ The device pronounces the time in the Home Assistant language (if enabled)

Everything happens automatically without the need to configure automations!

## 🗣️ Language handling

The language is automatically detected from:

self.hass.config.language

Announcement examples:

| Language | Time | Announcement |
|------|------|--------|
| 🇮🇹 IT | 10:30 | Ore 10 e trenta |
| 🇬🇧 EN | 14:00 | It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon |
| 🇫🇷 FR | 9:30 | Il est 9 heures trente |
| 🇩🇪 DE | 16:30 | Es ist halb 17 |
| 🇪🇸 ES | 11:00 | Son las 11 |
| 🇵🇱 PL | 15:30 | Wpół do czwartej |
| 🇨🇿 CS | 8:30 | Půl deváté |
| 🇸🇰 SK | 8:30 | Pol deviatej |
| 🇵🇹 PT | 10:30 | São 10 e meia |

## 🔔 Chime (initial bell)

If the use_chime option is active:
- the notification sound or the chosen sound is played
- the system waits 1.2 seconds
- the voice announcement starts (if enabled)

This creates an effect similar to a real pendulum 🎶.

## 🧩 Configuration options

## 🧪 Immediate test

Useful to verify: language, volume, chime, correct TTS operation
